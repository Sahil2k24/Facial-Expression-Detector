# Facial-Expression-Detector
The Project is Facial Expression Detector.

Facial expression recognition software is a technology which uses biometric markers to detect emotions in human faces. More precisely, this technology is a sentiment analysis tool and is able to automatically detect the five basic or universal expressions: happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, neutral.

Humans are well-trained in reading the emotions of others, in fact, at just 14 months old, babies can already tell the difference between happy and sad. But can computers do a better job than us in accessing emotional states? To answer the question, we designed a User Friendly Websites that give machines the ability to make inferences about our
emotional states

The software will extracts and analyze information from the image or video feed and will be able to deliver unfiltered and unbiased emotional responses as data.
